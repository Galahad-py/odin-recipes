# odin-recipes
The goal is to make a website which has a main page from which multiple pages can be accessed. In this case we are using a recipe page. I copied my recipes fromm allrecipes.
This aims to achieve the following;
familiarize myself with links; Relative/absolute/root-relative.
I also need to understand embedding images as well.
I also need to understand my use of list; ordered list and unordered list.
So far i have completed the task and have not encountered any difficulties.
